1. What is Scriptpable Data and what is it for?

Scriptable Data is a set of elemental Scriptable Objects containing primitive values. Think of them as integers, floats, booleans without a MonoBehaviour they necessarily belong to. This makes them a powerful tool for decoupling scripts like the player's actor and their health interface, saving data or plugging in different values for testing.
Unlike regular Scriptable Objects, the values of Scriptable Data's objects are reset to a default value when the game starts. Each Scriptable Data object has two default values that can be freely set: One for debugging, and one for production. You can toggle between the two via the Tools menu.
The production values are guaranteed to be used whenever in a build, so change the debug values during development freely!

2. Component List

- SaveInterface

A component hosting the SaveGameManager Scriptable Object. It provides access to the Scriptable Object's Save, Restore, Clear, Reset and Exists methods, used for inquiring the state of a save file in a specific save slot.

- ScriptableDataEvent/ListScriptableDataEvent

These components and their derived components give a component host to a ScriptableData object. Intended to be used for binding components in the scene to a Scriptable Data's event handlers.

- ConditionalEvent

Can be used for triggering an action in the scene when two ScriptableData object's values are equal or not equal.

3. ScriptableObject List

- ScriptableData / ListScriptableData

These SOs and their derived SOs contain elemental values in automatically resetting Scriptable Objects.
Value: Retrieves the current value of the object.
SetValueWithoutNotify: Bypasses the OnValueChanged event handler.
OnValueChanged: Can be used to bind a method to the data value changing.

- SaveDataManager

A ScriptableObject with a list of ScriptableData it should save to a save file. Save slots are supported in the Save, Restore, Clear, Reset and Exists methods. Can be used with the SaveInterface component or plugged into another script directly.

- SharedEvent

A ScriptableObject that merely contains a UnityEvent. Intended to be used for loose coupling of Unity Events between two objects.
